    Events are a way of saying something happened without knowing or caring about who is
listening, if anyone.
    There are publishers and subscribers. The publisher can store events and the subscribers
can subscribe to him. Multiple subscribers can subscribe to the same publisher.
Whenever the publisher fires off its events, all the subscribers get notified that these
had occurred.
    With this mechanism, it's possible to decouple essencial from optional code.
e.g.: separate a reusable logical code (publisher) from a visual code (subscriber) built
specifically to display an UI for that logical code.
